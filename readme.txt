feature-limited, limited to a certain number of uses, or limited to a
certain number of concurrent network users.

This is a source-only release of TurboPack OnGuard. It includes
designtime and runtime packages for Delphi and C++Builder.
It supports Win32 and Win64.

#ifdef _WIN64
#pragma comment(lib, "%packagename%")
